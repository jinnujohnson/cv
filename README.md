# CV - Jinnu Johnson

I am a software developer who likes writing PHP and RUBY programs. I enjoy working on different parts of the stack such as the front-end logic, querying databases and writing programs. I am not afraid to get my hands dirty to find the most suitable solutions for the projectâ€™s requirements. I am currently learning RUBY and finding it really fun.

Ultimately, my goal is to become awesome at writing simple, robust, scalable and readable code - through practice, learning and applying different programming paradigms, and by studying the approaches of other developers.
